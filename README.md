# TRIGGERS
## Definition: A trigger is a special type of stored procedure that automatically executes when a specific event occurs on a table. 
## These events can include:
    1. INSERT: When a new row is inserted into the table.
    2. UPDATE: When an existing row in the table is modified.
    3. DELETE: When a row is deleted from the table.
    
## Purpose:

    1. Data Integrity: Enforce business rules and constraints (e.g., ensuring that the values in a column fall within a certain range).
    2. Auditing: Track changes made to the database (e.g., record who modified a record and when).
    3. Cascading Updates: Automatically update related tables when changes occur in one table.
    4. Data Synchronization: Keep related data in sync across multiple tables.

# EVENNT
## Definition: Events are scheduled tasks that are executed automatically at specified intervals or based on certain conditions. 
## Purpose:
    1. Scheduled Tasks: Perform routine maintenance tasks (e.g., database backups, data cleanup).
    2. Monitoring: Monitor database activity and trigger actions based on certain conditions.
    3. Data Synchronization: Synchronize data between different databases.
